# Replit Live Follower Count
This is a project based on [Gautam](https://replit.com/@CoderGautamYT)'s [Replit Live Follower Count](https://replit.com/@CoderGautamYT/Replit-Live-Follower-Count). The main difference is that our project shows the following count for any user instead of just one. 

While the code works, it doesn't necessarily work *well*. I haven't coded in a while, and others that helped don't know Python.
